      <h1><u>Spain!</u></h1>
      
      <p>I have only been to Spain twice but it is <strong> the best </strong> country i've visited to. <br>
        Once was doing touristy things and the next time I stayed with my best friend and her family.<br>
        Here were my favorite places and things to eat.  </p>

      <h3><u> My Top 3 cities:</u></h3>
 <ul>
   <li> Barcelona </li>
   <li> Madrid </li>
   <li> Valencia </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        
      Barcelona and Valencia are very similar since they are so close geographically, <br> 
        but Madrid is  very unique </p>
      <h3><u>Favorite foods:</u></h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Valencianas </li>
    <li> Bombon </li>
    <li> Olives </li>
      </ul>

       <p>
   Valencianas are little cakes individually wrapped and a Bombon is black coffee with condensed milk. The olives in Spain are very popular because they are <em>so fresh</em>
